# SpaceX Telemetry Extractor

Automated telemetry data extraction from SpaceX Starship launch webcasts using OCR.

## Overview

This tool extracts real-time telemetry data from SpaceX launch webcast frames including:
- Stage 1 Speed (km/h)
- Stage 1 Altitude (km)
- Stage 2 Speed (km/h)
- Stage 2 Altitude (km)
- Timestamp (HH:MM:SS)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Tesseract OCR
- Dependencies from requirements.txt:
numpy opencv-python pytesseract pyyaml natsort


## Configuration

The `default_config.yaml` contains key parameters that can be manually modified if needed.

## Features

Image Processing
Grayscale conversion
Binary thresholding
Morphological operations for noise reduction
OCR Validation
Confidence threshold filtering
Sequence validation for altitude readings
Natural descent handling (e.g., 10km â†’ 9km transitions)
Speed range and deviation checks
Detailed logging for debugging
Data Output
CSV format with timestamps
Handles missing/invalid readings
Maintains data consistency

## Usage

Image frames
The program needs individual frames of the webcast. 
Currently using https://github.com/CMoiClem/video-frame-extractor for that, but I will integrate them all together later. 



Arguments
--frames-dir: Directory containing video frame images
--output: Path for output CSV file
--config: Path to configuration YAML

Validation Logic
Altitude:
Rejects single digits after double digits unless natural descent
Allows small decreases during descent (configurable)
Strict increases validation (max 2 units)

Speed:
Range validation (0-40000 km/h)
Statistical validation using rolling window
Deviation checks from mean

Detailed logging of:
OCR readings and confidence
Validation decisions
Processing errors
Output in telemetry_extractor.log

## Known Limitations
OCR accuracy depends on frame brightness
Some readings may be missed during rapid changes
Requires specific SpaceX overlay format

## Future Improvements
Support for different overlay formats (Falcon 9)
Individual frames extraction from a webcast
Easy way to download webcasts from X
GUI development
Automating graph creation from the telemetry CSV
